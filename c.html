    The Madras High Court [1] is one of the oldest High Courts of India. It is located in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. The court is one of the three High Courts in India established in the three Presidency Towns of Madras, Bombay and Calcutta by letters patent granted by Queen Victoria, bearing date 26 June 1862. It exercises original jurisdiction over the city of Chennai and appellate jurisdiction over the entire state of Tamil Nadu and Union territory of Puducherry, as well as extraordinary original jurisdiction, civil and criminal, under the letters patent and special original jurisdiction for the issue of writs under the Constitution of India.[2][3] Covering 107 acres, the court complex is one of the largest in the world, next only to Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, London.

    It consists of 74 judges and a chief justice who are in charge of the general policy adopted in the administration of justice.[3] In September 2016, the centre government forwarded the names of 15 new judges to the President for his signature on their warrants of appointment. Of the 15, nine are from among lawyers and six from the subordinate judiciary.
